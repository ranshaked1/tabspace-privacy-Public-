        <h1>Privacy Policy for TabSpace</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> February 13, 2026</p>

        <h2>The Bottom Line: We Respect Your Privacy</h2>
        <p>TabSpace is designed from the ground up to be a privacy-first application. We believe that your browsing habits and data are your own. Our commitment is simple: **TabSpace collects, stores, transmits, or shares absolutely no personal data.**</p>

        <h2>What Data Does TabSpace Handle?</h2>
        <p>TabSpace needs to store the workspaces you create, including the names, icons, colors, and URLs of the tabs within them. It also stores your custom keyboard shortcuts and theme preferences.</p>

        <h2>Where is This Data Stored?</h2>
        <p>All of the data mentioned above is stored **exclusively on your local computer** using the standard Chrome Storage API (`chrome.storage.local`). This data never leaves your machine and is not sent to any external server or third-party service. It is physically located on the same computer where you have installed the extension.</p>

        <h2>Data Collection</h2>
        <p>We do not use any analytics, tracking cookies, or third-party scripts to monitor your usage of the extension or your browsing activity.</p>

        <h2>Permissions</h2>
        <p>TabSpace requests the minimum permissions necessary to function:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>"storage":</strong> To save your workspaces and settings locally on your device.</li>
            <li><strong>"tabs" and "tabGroups":</strong> To open, organize, and manage the tabs within your workspaces when you launch them.</li>
            <li><strong>"contextMenus":</strong> To provide the "Add to Workspace" option when you right-click on a page.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>If we ever change this policy in the future, we will update this document and provide clear information about what has changed. However, our core principle of not collecting personal data will not change.</p>
